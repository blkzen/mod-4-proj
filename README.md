# Module 4 Final Project
## *Image Classification with Deep Learning


### Library & Data Input¶
* A list of imports for libraries, methods, and functions used in this project.



### O.　『Obtain』
* Batches of data are generated for images allocated for training, testing, and validation.



### S.　『Scrub』
* Our images are rescaled for the sake of uniformity.



### E.　『Explore』 
* Preprocess for the model 
* Image tensors are set
* We take a look at one of the images



### M.　『Model』
* Model created
* 30 epochs, accuracy of 93%



### N.　『iNterpret』
* Model saved
* Data augmented
* Accuracy and loss visualized



### Conclusion
We formatted thousands of x-rays of patients with and without pneumonia. After doing so, we created a model that processes these images, creates convulsions when reading the images, and gave us an accuracy of 93% at its highest.
